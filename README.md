# -Jaseci---Windows-AI-Project-Repo
*This project is to support building an AI Application using JAC language with Jaseci - Making the groundwork | Project 01*

***Jaseci based testing projects***

Here I'll be testing the codes to create graphs with minimum errors. This initial project will support to create the end product at the mail AI Project.
I'll be covering from initializing the Codespace and creating  the server which needs to connect to the Jaseci studio when you work in Windows.
